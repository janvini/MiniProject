Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
These libraries can be installed using a Python package manager such as pip.

Usage

Data Exploration: The notebook starts with loading the dataset and exploring its structure to understand the data's distribution and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform other necessary transformations.
Modeling: Several machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data. The models are evaluated using relevant metrics to determine their performance.
Visualization: The notebook includes visualizations to better understand the data and the performance of the models.
This project serves as a practical example of the machine learning workflow, from raw data to model evaluation.
